# Pulumi vs Terraform

Pulumi and Terraform are popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools that enable developers to manage and deploy infrastructure resources using code.

Terraform is a widely-used open-source tool that allows developers to define infrastructure resources as code using a domain-specific language (DSL) called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Terraform supports a variety of cloud providers and services, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, among others. It allows users to define their infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, networks, and storage, and manage them in a modular and reusable way. Terraform also provides features like plan, apply, and destroy to help users manage changes to their infrastructure resources.

Pulumi, on the other hand, is a newer tool that allows developers to define infrastructure resources using familiar programming languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Go. Pulumi supports a range of cloud providers and services, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as Kubernetes and other infrastructure platforms. Pulumi is designed to enable users to create and manage infrastructure as code using the programming languages and tools they are already familiar with. Pulumi also provides a wide range of libraries and tools to help users manage their infrastructure resources.

Both Pulumi and Terraform are popular for their ability to enable developers to manage infrastructure as code, automate infrastructure deployments, and ensure consistency and repeatability across different environments. They both provide a range of features and integrations that make it easier for developers to manage their infrastructure resources, regardless of the cloud provider or platform they are using.
