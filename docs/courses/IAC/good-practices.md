# IaC: ~~Best~~ Good Practices & Releases

## Introduction

This page will look to cover IaC good practices, as well as a process for releasing IaC.<br/>
A lot of these would already be obvious or widely known, but its useful to retain a reference point.

Also I write good rather than best, as at time of writing and as far as I'm aware, they are the best practices.<br/>
However I'd rather not publicly get roasted and have to live with the shame...

## ~~Best~~ Good Practices

Make code your single source of truth. You should explicitly code all the infrastructure specifications in configuration files. Your configuration files should be the single source of truth for all your infrastructure management concerns.
Version control all of your configuration files. This probably should go without saying, but put all of your config files under source control.
Use little documentation (or none at all) for your infrastructure specifications. This point is the logical consequence of the first one. Since your config files should be your single source of truth, there should be no need for more documentation. External documentation can easily get out of sync with the real configurations, but that wonâ€™t happen with the config files.
Test and Monitor Your Configurations. IaC is code, and like all code, it can be tested. So test it you should! By employing testing and monitoring tools for IaC, you can check for errors and inconsistencies in your servers before you deploy them to production.

Version control: Store all IaC code in a version control system such as Git to track changes, collaborate with team members, and revert to previous versions if necessary.

Modularity: Break IaC code into smaller, reusable modules that can be easily shared and tested. This helps simplify infrastructure configuration and maintenance.

Documentation: Document all infrastructure components, including their purpose, configuration, and dependencies. This helps other team members understand how the infrastructure is configured and how changes will affect the system.

Testing: Develop and maintain a suite of tests that verify the correct configuration of infrastructure components. This helps catch errors early in the development process and reduces the risk of configuration issues in production.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automate the deployment and testing of infrastructure changes using a CI/CD pipeline. This helps ensure that changes are tested and deployed quickly and consistently.

Security: Implement security best practices such as role-based access control, network segmentation, and data encryption. Regularly audit and update security configurations to ensure that they are up-to-date and effective.

Monitoring: Set up monitoring and alerting for all infrastructure components to detect issues and respond quickly. This helps ensure that the infrastructure is available and performing as expected.

Compliance: Ensure that IaC code and infrastructure configurations comply with relevant regulations and standards, such as HIPAA, PCI, and GDPR.

Collaboration: Foster collaboration between development and operations teams to ensure that infrastructure code aligns with development requirements and that infrastructure changes are tested and deployed efficiently.

Disaster Recovery: Implement disaster recovery measures to ensure that infrastructure can be quickly restored in the event of a failure or outage. This can include backup and restore procedures, redundancy, and failover mechanisms.

Scalability: Design infrastructure code to be scalable, so that it can easily accommodate changes in demand or usage. This can include using auto-scaling groups or load balancers, and designing infrastructure to be horizontally scalable.

Configuration Management: Use configuration management tools to manage the installation, configuration, and maintenance of infrastructure components. This helps ensure consistency and reproducibility across environments.

Optimization: Regularly review and optimize infrastructure configurations to ensure that they are cost-effective and efficient. This can include identifying and removing unused resources, optimizing performance, and improving security.

Compliance as Code: Use IaC to automate the configuration and management of compliance requirements. This can include implementing security controls, enforcing policies, and generating audit reports.

## Release Processes

Development Stage: During the development stage, software and infrastructure changes are developed and tested in a development or staging environment. This stage may include several sub-stages, such as planning, design, coding, testing, and review.

Testing Stage: In the testing stage, changes are tested in a dedicated testing environment to ensure that they function as expected and do not introduce new issues. This stage may include various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, functional testing, and performance testing.

Deployment Stage: During the deployment stage, changes are deployed to a production environment. The deployment process may involve several sub-stages, such as pre-deployment checks, deployment execution, post-deployment checks, and verification.

There are several approaches to release processes, including continuous delivery and continuous deployment.

Continuous Delivery: In continuous delivery, changes are continuously tested and deployed to a staging environment, where they are ready for release at any time. The release decision is made by a human, who may decide to release changes periodically or on an ad-hoc basis.

Continuous Deployment: In continuous deployment, changes are automatically deployed to a production environment as soon as they pass testing. This approach requires a high degree of automation and rigorous testing to ensure that changes are released safely.

Development Environment: The development environment is where infrastructure changes are developed and tested. It may include lower-tier infrastructure resources with lower specifications or cheaper SKU, such as smaller VMs, less powerful database instances, and less expensive storage options. The goal of the development environment is to ensure that infrastructure changes work as expected and do not break existing functionality, while minimizing costs.

Testing Environment: The testing environment is where changes are tested before they are deployed to production. It is typically a replica of the production environment and may include higher-tier infrastructure resources with higher specifications or more expensive SKU, such as larger VMs, more powerful database instances, and faster storage options. The goal of the testing environment is to identify any issues or bugs that were not caught in the development environment and to ensure that the changes are ready for production, while still maintaining reasonable costs.

Production Environment: The production environment is where the live application or service runs and serves end-users. It includes the highest-tier infrastructure resources with the most powerful specifications or most expensive SKU, such as large VMs with high CPU and memory specifications, highly available database instances, and fast, durable storage options. The goal of the production environment is to provide high availability, reliability, and performance to end-users, while maintaining appropriate levels of security and cost.

By using different infrastructure SKUs and environments for development, testing, and production, organizations can ensure that infrastructure changes are thoroughly tested and deployed safely, while minimizing costs and maximizing performance and availability for end-users.


Benefits:

Automation: IaC allows for the automated provisioning and management of infrastructure, reducing the need for manual intervention and improving efficiency.

Consistency: IaC ensures that infrastructure is configured in a consistent and repeatable way, reducing the risk of errors and increasing reliability.

Versioning: IaC tools allow for the versioning of infrastructure, making it easier to track changes over time and roll back to previous versions if needed.

Collaboration: IaC encourages collaboration between teams, as infrastructure can be managed and updated through code repositories, allowing for easier sharing and collaboration.
