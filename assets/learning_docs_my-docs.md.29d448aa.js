Keep writing</strong></p><p>Its a tech blog, I am fortuante to be in a tech role. So I&#39;ve started the habit of keeping notes while working on something new, or even solving a problem. Even if it isn&#39;t something published it&#39;s always something that can be referenced.</p><p>Currently I&#39;m hiding out in my office waiting for my new role to start in 8 days time, with my wifes long list of house todos and 2 seasons of Vikings to watch I&#39;m limited for time! Despite not having anything new and shiney to work on, coming off an exciting Azure ML project but sadly decided to move on.<br> I will aim to commit to forming a habbit, by working an hour a day towards a post or course. The timespent will be in either writing, learning or implementing something with hopes of brining it to this site.</p><p><strong>2. Don&#39;t hide behind jargon</strong></p><p><code>&quot;If you want to master something teach it.&quot; - Richard Feynman</code></p><p>We can&#39;t teach someone by confusing them!</p><p>Documents are meant to be useful as well as readable.<br> Jargon often leads to over complicated documents, which will put off those who don&#39;t really have a clue what you&#39;re talking about. In a years time that can also include the writer themselves!</p><p>It is sometimes needed, but if flaunted about too frequently it&#39;s often in an attempt to either show off or hide lack of true understanding.<br> The same can also be said for meetings, where jargon can lead to confusion, at best. At worst can lead to a team following someone blindly who didn&#39;t even understand their own sentance, but used big words and now we&#39;re 1/2 way into our sprint not knowing why we went down this route. (Yes I&#39;ve been there, yes I may have been the blind man leading)...</p><p>Keep it clear, cohesive and concise (Something I&#39;m struggling with).</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="Contridiction"></p><p><strong>3. Break up the writing</strong></p><p>Look to incorporate diagrams to either replace text or to make you&#39;re writing more understandable.<br> Don&#39;t do what I do which is throwing gifs in left, right and centre!</p><p><strong>4. Edit</strong></p><p>Once you&#39;ve written your page, re-read the masterpiece to make sure everything is sound. If it doesn&#39;t help you or the reader, bin it!<br> Take time to also have a bit of fun with it - elaborate your notes within the post, inject some personality into it and away we go.</p><p>Once you&#39;ve read it through and are happy, publish it and never look back (unless someone including yourself has feedback, corrections or hates it).</p><p>Actually this is a lie, always look back dust off your old documents, and see how you can add to or improve. You also want to remember what&#39;s covered, much like code you don&#39;t want to repeat yourself.</p><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><h3 id="notes" tabindex="-1">Notes <a class="header-anchor" href="#notes" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>I currently use <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">obsidian</a> for my day to day note taking, it&#39;s quick easy to use and is apparently my second brain.... so why wouldn&#39;t I use it.<br> For personal use it is completely free, there are tonnes of community plugins, key one&#39;s I use are mindmap visualisers, kanban boards and spell check. For me it just makes note taking and document linking a lot easier.<br> I&#39;m sure there are other powerfull plugins I could be using, but the templating and the fact it&#39;s in markdown, easily transferrable to this blog is a no brainer.</p><p>I mean I could just publish this blog using obsidian, but I enjoy using a variety of tools to make my life harder.</p><h3 id="diagrams" tabindex="-1">Diagrams <a class="header-anchor" href="#diagrams" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>I should say <a href="http://draw.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">draw.io</a>, but I&#39;m embarrassed to say I&#39;ve used, and still use visio ðŸ«£ I&#39;ve been predominately within the Azure space for the past 3 years so it just makes sense.</p><p>But to make docs and presentations more fun I&#39;ve been leaning towards <a href="https://excalidraw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">excalidraw.</a> It just gives the whole diagram a sketchy, hand drawn look which I can&#39;t help but feel drawn to - I mean it just looks awesome!</p><h3 id="blog" tabindex="-1">Blog <a class="header-anchor" href="#blog" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p><a href="https://vitepress.vuejs.org/guide/what-is-vitepress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vitepress</a> is in alpha, so don&#39;t use unless you&#39;re willing to keep up with potentially breaking changes, but it&#39;s extremely lightweight, whilst still allowing the use of vue components.</p><p>If you would like to follow suit, I&#39;ve written a how to in the <a href="./this-blog.html">previous page</a></p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Thats it for now!
